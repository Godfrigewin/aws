Linux directory structure/file structure:
-----------------------------------------

Folders---windows
Directory---MAC,Linux,AIX

/--->parent directory/root directory

/home - is a sub-directory, contains all users information.
	for each user one directory will be created in Linux
	/home/divya
/lib - contains system libraries -- accessable by all the three users
/sbin - system bin - shutdown and reboot -- only the root user can access all directories and files under it
/bin - contains all binary files of commands -- accessable by all the three users
/etc - contains all the configuration files -- only root user can access
	sudoers
	passwd
	shadow
	group
	cron.allow
/var - contain variable files or log files -- normal user as well as root user cann access this directory
/opt - optional by default this directory will be empty. this directory is used only for s/w installation -- 	only root user can access this directory
/proc - process. for every command there will be a process id generated and that will be stored in this 	directory or this directory also contain important CPU information as well -- any user can access
/dev - used by working professional and development environment is the abbrivation of dev. contains all device 	information -- normal user and root user
/tmp - temporary directory. can be accessed by all the user.
	As a normal user we cannot access the other user home directory. So we can have a common temporary 		directory for all user through which each user can access everyother users directory stored in tem dir'

Types of users in Linux:
-------------------------
1. root user -1 root user --admin user
2. normal user - 'n' no.of normal user
3. system user - user is created by s/w installation
	ex: Jenkins--->Jenkins
